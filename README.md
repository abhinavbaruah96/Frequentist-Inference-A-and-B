# Frequentist-Inference-A-and-B
In part A, learned to apply the Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference. In Part B, applied those implementations to a real-world scenario. 
Implemented the following concepts as you we work through the case study:

The z-statistic
The t-statistic
The Central Limit Theorem
Estimation of the population standard deviation and mean, from a sample
Sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
Calculating confidence intervals and p-values
Hypothesis testing
